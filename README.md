Hi! Shown below is my audio sampler designed using the JUCE framework.

To download on Mac:

  1. navigate to the release section of the right sidebar and click on the latest release

  2. click on the asset labelled "MUS12_Sampler_Mac.pkg", which should begin downloading

  3. Attempt to open this download on your computer.  If it gets blocked by a pop-up that 
     says something like "MUS12_Sampler_Mac.pkg cannot be opened because it is from an 
     unidentified developer", that is okay.
     
  4. To resolve this issue navigate to your computer's systems security settings by following: 
     preferences > security & privacy.  From here there should be an option to allow your 
     computer to open up MUS12_Sampler_Mac.pkg anyways, bypassing Apple's security check.
     
  5. once MUS12_Sampler_Mac.pkg is open, follow the installation instructions on the pop-up.
     the sampler will be automatically loaded into /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3.
     
  6. From here you should be good to use the sampler in any DAW of your choice that can handle 
     VST3 plugins. Some DAW's may have additional security blocks for third party plugins 
     which may need to be resolved.
